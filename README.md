# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

In order to determine the best "Green" stocks to invest in, a workbook was created to analyze total volume traded and the return on 12 different stocks on an annualized basis. Additionaly, the VBA macro used to perform these functions was refactored to reduce the time spent performing the macro.
